# Heap Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n). 
# The efficiency of Heap Sort depends on the time required to build the max-heap, which has a time complexity of O(n), 
#and the time required to perform the swap and reconstruct the max-heap, which has a time complexity of O(log n). 
#Therefore, the overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n).
# Heap Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm requiring O(1) space complexity.
